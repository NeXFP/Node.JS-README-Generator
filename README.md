# Node.JS README Generator

## Description
This is an application using Node that generates a professionally written README based on User input. Using an array of questions, we prompt for user input that follow with 
different messages when using terminal. Based on the input made by the user, the input is then displayed in the README. This application also displays badges and links to licenses when the user selects a license from the list provided in the program.
